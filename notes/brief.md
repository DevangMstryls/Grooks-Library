Book library system. 

What you will be building :
A classic online book library has all the features of a physical library. Online book library system should be user friendly and easy to understand . User should be able to perform below functionality with the system: 

1. Adding the book with details like book name , book description , count ,author etc ..  (While adding you can save the book detail in redux store and leverage the same values while searching).
2. Searching the book
3. Editing a particular book detail
4. Also create a page with the list of all the books listed in the system.
Developer can develop the View of the. Web based on his/her liking . View should be as responsive as possible.

Make sure to follow these points :
1. Use framework of your choice either angular or react, if using angular use 4+
2. Use a state conatainer, flux or redux choice is yours
3. Do not use any css framework like material or bootstrap
4. Make sure your application looks good in mobile, tab and desktop (choose a design of your choice)
5. Use a build tool of your choice
6. Donâ€™t spend time in making ui look better, spend time in having proper component based approach
7. typescript is preferred over javascript


Good to have :
1. Have a node js backend which will be used to read and persist books to a json file
2. UI will interact with Backend using proper http/rest calls
